Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build and train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a systemic crisis in Africa based on key economic indicators, such as annual inflation rates and other macroeconomic factors.

This work is based on the "Systemic Crisis, Banking Crisis, Inflation Crisis in Africa" dataset from Kaggle, and serves as a checkpoint for understanding crisis prediction using historical financial and economic data.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Instructions & Workflow
üßæ Data Handling & Preprocessing
Import and Explore the Dataset

Load the data and perform a basic inspection (head, shape, types, nulls, etc.).

Display General Information

Use .info() and .describe() to understand the dataset structure and statistics.

Generate a Profiling Report

Use pandas_profiling to create a visual data report for deeper insight.

Handle Missing or Corrupted Values

Apply appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal.

Remove Duplicates

Eliminate redundant rows to prevent skewed learning.

Handle Outliers

Identify and treat outliers using visual tools (boxplots, z-scores, IQR).

Encode Categorical Features

Use encoding methods like Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables.

Select Features and Target Variable

Choose relevant input features and define the target variable (Systemic_crisis, for example).

Split the Dataset

Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., using train_test_split() from scikit-learn).

ü§ñ Model Building & Evaluation
Select a Suitable ML Model

Choose a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) depending on data shape and complexity.

Train the Model

Fit the model on the training data.

Evaluate the Model

Use metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Score (for binary classification)
